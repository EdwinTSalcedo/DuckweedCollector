# CAD Design USV

## Description
This repository contains the CAD designs for an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) specifically designed for the collection of water lentils. The design includes all the parts that were used to 3D print the vehicle, such as the "Control Box", "Main Body", "Floaters", and "Main Grid".

## Repository Contents
The repository is organized with the following files:

### Part Files
- `Aux_1`, `Aux_2`, `Aux_3`: Support structures.
- `BackSupport`: Used for the net grip that collects water lentils.
- `BatteryCover`: Covers the battery housing area.
- `BoltHolder`: Holder for bolts.
- `BoxLid`: Lid for the control box.
- `ElectronicBox`: Housing for the electronic components.
- `Flipper`: Grip for the motors.
- `FloaterBase`: Base structure for the floaters.
- `FloaterLeftBack`, `FloaterLeftFront`, `FloaterRightBack`, `FloaterRightFront`: The four parts of the floaters for 3D printing.
- `FrontSupport`: Frontal support structure.
- `Grid`: Filtering grid.
- `Joint`: Joint component.
- `UpperStructure`: Upper structure of the vehicle.
- `VentLid`: Lid for ventilation.

### Assembly File
